# Big Shop

A nextjs static site and a go api

## running the app
```
npm run dev
```
Requires node 14+

## backlog
https://trello.com/b/LnaGkQyG/bigshop

## deploying
This is handled automatically by netlify.

The lambda used to connect to planetscale DB. Since they dropped the free tier is connects to TiDB.

### local setup

Lots to do here.
- Setup netlify-lambda package for local dev
- Configure the app to connect to a local db
- local env vars

For running the UI:
- Disable auth by setting `behindAuth` to `false` in _app.js
- Turn on mocks with `useMocks`


### local db
To enter the mysql workspace:
```
mysql -u root
use bigshop;
```

- db user
```
CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bigshop.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
```

#### Auth
The API is behind auth and I haven't come up with a nice way of configuring that yet for use via curl/postman. Via the app it's fine. For now I copy an authorization token from the application requests and use that in the auth header. Big todo.

## runnning db migrations
I haven't created a decent workflow for this yet :(

I've also been using workbench for dumping the db from prod to local.
